# 🛠️ PROJECT TITLE: Q-Less

## Idea Abstract

**This project digitizes the CET Civil Canteen to eliminate queues. Students order via a real-time app that generates a unique QR code for their purchase. Staff use a live dashboard with a built-in scanner to instantly verify payment by scanning the student's code, making the entire process fast, seamless, and foolproof.**
